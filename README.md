# Markowitzâ€™s Portfolio Optimization Analysis

This repository contains the comprehensive analysis and methodology of constructing a diversified investment portfolio using Markowitz's Portfolio Optimization Model, with a focus on technology stocks in light of the AI boom from 2023-2024, and balanced with other sector stocks for diversification.

## Executive Summary

The report encapsulates the journey of constructing a portfolio that captures the growth momentum of AI-infused technology stocks and mitigates risk through diversification. It explores a combined portfolio approach, integrating the strengths of both the optimal and equally weighted strategies.

## Background

Set against the backdrop of a significant surge in AI technology stocks in 2023-2024, this project aims to navigate the bullish market sentiment and harness the performance potential of innovative tech firms.

## Markowitz Model Overview

Leveraging Harry Markowitz's foundational work on portfolio optimization, this project seeks to balance the risk-reward equation, utilizing historical data to chart an efficient frontier for strategic asset allocation.

## Objective

The primary goal is to develop a strategic investment portfolio that aligns with moderate risk appetite, targeting higher than average returns, benchmarked against the SPY ETF and an equally weighted portfolio. The project further examines the efficacy of a 50/50 allocation between the optimal portfolio and the 1/N strategy.

## Methodologies

- **Data Collection**: Historical price data for select stocks and SPY ETF were collected and divided into training and test datasets.

- **Estimation**: Daily returns, expected returns, and covariance matrices were computed to inform the portfolio construction.

- **Portfolio Construction**: Both minimum-risk and zero-covariance portfolios were derived to form the basis of the optimal portfolios under varying risk aversions.

- **Efficient Frontier Analysis**: The portfolios were plotted against the efficient frontier to evaluate their risk-return profiles.

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis concluded that the combined portfolio offers a balanced approach for investors looking to capitalize on the tech sector's growth while managing investment risks prudently.
